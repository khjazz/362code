## Files

In src/:

- `main.py`: The main server program, starts the flask server.
- `login_stat.py`: Contains the LoginStat class for logging user logins into files.
- `validation.py`: Contains validation functions for user info and request.
- `quote_client.py`: Contains functions for retrieving quotes from the remote server.
- `user.py`: Contains the User class for validate user login
- `pi_estimator.py`: Contains the multiprocess pi estimating function and helper functions
- `test_main.py`: Contains four classes of testcases:
  - `TestLoginValidation`: Tests for the login validation logic
  - `TestLoginStat`: Tests for the login statistics functionality
  - `TestPiEndpoint`: Tests for the pi service with valid and invalid input
  - `TestQuoteEndpoint`: Tests for the quote service with valid and invalid input

## Setup

Python>=3.11

Flask>=3.0

Start the quote server:
```
$ python quote_server.py
```

## Running the server

In the project root directory:

Setting the logging level to production and run `src/main.py`

Windows:

```
$ set PROD=1
$ python src\main.py
```

Mac/Linux:

```
$ PROD=1 python src/main.py
```

## Running the tests

In the project root directory:

```
$ python src/test_main.py
```

## Format for login statistics

The login statistics are stored directly in the root object of a JSON file named `login_stat.json` in the current working directory. The format is as follows:

| Key (String) | Value Type (Integer) | Description                      |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| username     | logincount           | The number of logins by the user |

Each key-value pair represents a user and their login count. The key is the username and the value is the number of times they have logged in.

## Server log
The server log is stored in a log file named `serverinfo.log`. It logs when the users are connected, or failed to login, or invalid input data with IP address, username, and error message if applicable.

## Concurrency solutions in the two web services

In both services, I use the PoolExecutor from the concurrent.futures module. The executors are created in the main block instead of in the endpoint functions. So that I only create them once for the lifetime of the app instead of create one for each request and destroy them after processing the request.

### Pi service

For the pi estimation service, the `ProcessPoolExecutor` is a more suitable choice. The monte carlo simulation used is a CPU-bound algorithm, it involves large amount of random number generations and arithmetic operations. As threading in python don't support true parallelism due to the GIL, only a CPU core is used at the same time, using threading for this task provides no real benefit to the performance. Python's multiprocessing supports CPU parallelism, this allows distributing the computation tasks into mulitple CPU cores and doing at the same time. This speed up the estimation process significantly.

### Quote service

On the other hand, for the Quote service, the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is more suitable. This is because the task of sending requests to the quote server and waiting for the response is I/O-bound, not CPU-bound. Most of time the CPU is waiting on idle. While one thread is waiting for IO completion, the OS scheduler can switch to another thread and initiate request. This allows the Quote service to send multiple requests to the quote server in parallel, significantly speeding up the overall response time. In general, creating processes has higher overheads than creating threads, therefore, using threads enables higher performance uplifts than processes.

## Discussion of adopting advanced technologies

### MPI

I can write the pi estimation alogrithm using Message Passing Interface (MPI). In my current implementation, the pi estimation consists of two parts, a single-process pi estimation function and helper function that use executors to distribute task to multiple process of the pi estimation function. This is logically similar to the single program multiple data (SPMD) model of MPI: the distributor is the root process and the estimators are the child process. And the root gathers and aggregates the pi estimates.

To do so, I have to install MPI tool on my computer and the mpi4py module for python. And I could modify the code like this:
```
from mpi4py import 

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD # the world intracommunicator
rank = comm.Get_rank() # the rank of current process
size = comm.Get_size() # the number of processes

if rank = 0:
    # distribute tasks
    # aggreates subresult
else
    # estimate pi
    # return the subresult
```
When the estimation program is written in MPI, I cannot call it as a function in my service, as MPI programs are needed to be used with the MPI utility program. I can use the `subprocess` modules to run OS native command to run the MPI tool to run the program with SPMD support.

Currently, the pi service only support up to 8 concurrency level, and it does not actually benefits from using MPI as the process have the same effect to MPI. However, assume the service is supporting much more concurrency levels says, 10000 and is upgrading into a high performance computing cluster. The multiprocessing solution is not working anymore because it does not support communication accross cluster nodes. Code written with MPI model can be deployed to a cluster and the program will be run distributed across the nodes. This enables making use of the cluster's computing facilities.

### asyncio networking

For the quotes service, ThreadPoolExecutor can be replaced with  coroutine. Like threading, coroutine allows speeding up IO bound tasks by running the tasks concurrently. The main difference is the with threading, the threads are assigned task based on the OS scheduler. And when the a network operation is being executed, the thread is blocked. And the OS find another thread to request from the quote server if there is any thread available or wait the the current operation complete to release the thread. This threads are wasted waiting on the IO task complete in idle. On the other hand, the asynchronous programming model allows the program to resuse a thread for doing non-blocking network operation. The asyncio module provides non-blocking networking facilies tha can be used to send and recieve from the quote server. And when the service is busy communicating with the quote server, the thread resource can be release for other concurreny requests. This prevent wasting threads resources.

This involves changing from using methods of the socket library to network facilities provides by asyncio library. For the async network opeartion, I can use the await keyword to signal that the thread can be released when the operation is running. And the client functions `start_tcp_client` and `start_udp_client` can be convert into coroutines. Then I can turn the `get_quotes` function to a corroutine that create a list of client coroutines and await them complete. In the flask endpoint, I can use `asyncio.run` to run the `get_quotes` coroutine to obtains the quotes. This turns the whole chain of functions into coroutines that support asynchronous IO.

This is very useful for handling a very large amount of request to the quote server, for example, if the web service is changed to service 100,000,000 conconcurrency level to get 100,000,000 quotes from the server, it does not need to create 100,000,000 processes or threads with the asynchronous programming appraoches, the event loop mechanism is used such that when the async networking call is called and awaiting for result, it return the control back and handle other requests. This significantly reduce memeory usage.
